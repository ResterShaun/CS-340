# CS-340
# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? 

concise code, simplistic variables, comment out each section for quick revision and adaptation. CRUD module can be utilized for future DB projects.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? 

This project was my first time working on Data Bases which my friend who works in the industry said was arguably the cornerstone for Computer Science. The approach is very detail oriented, from the pre-planning all the way to implementation and working on the DBs and creation of the dashboard. One wrong key stroke could have massive repercussions. Working in this course taught me just how important verifying your work is in this field.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better? 

Computer scientists focus on data, programming, and robotics/AI all to make the day to day lives of ever more simplistic. This type of project allows a company to have access to a database with a simple platform for viewing. Helping their carbon footprint by converting all their data away from paper files which also gives them ease of access, being they can find information at the click of a button instead of rummaging through thousands of paper files.
